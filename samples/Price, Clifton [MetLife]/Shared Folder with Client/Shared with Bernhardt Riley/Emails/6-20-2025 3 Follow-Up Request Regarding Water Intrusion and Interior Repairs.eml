Good afternoon Irina,

Thank you for arranging the moisture readings, they have now set up a fan
and dehumidifier and I was told that repairs to the baseboards are to come
after the moisture has been handled. It=E2=80=99s good to see that steps ha=
ve been
taken to help address the interior and begin drying out the affected areas.

I wanted to mention that I received notice that someone would be arriving
with about 10 minutes=E2=80=99 lead time. While I understand scheduling can=
 be
challenging, it would be very helpful if we could coordinate with the
standard notice period for future visits so I can plan accordingly.

I=E2=80=99d also like to note that the moisture testing was arranged after =
I raised
the concern. I=E2=80=99m relieved this was handled once it was brought up, =
and I
hope we can work together to ensure these kinds of assessments happen as
early as possible if similar issues arise.

Regarding the moisture readings: since elevated levels (48 and above) were
found and it has now been over nine days since the flooding occurred, I=E2=
=80=99m
concerned about the potential for mold growth. I understand that mold can
begin developing within 24 to 48 hours of elevated moisture, and given that
this is the sixth or seventh instance of flooding in the unit, it=E2=80=99s
possible that dormant spores from earlier events may have been reactivated
this time. While I appreciate that drying equipment has been set up, I
think it would be prudent to arrange for a professional mold assessment or
air quality testing to ensure there is no hidden growth and that the
apartment remains safe and healthy.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing how we
can proceed.

Thank you,
Cliff Price
