Hi Irina,

Thank you for the update. While I appreciate that drying equipment was set
up and that repairs are being scheduled, I am increasingly concerned that
key steps are being skipped or minimized at each stage of this process -
steps that are important not just as a matter of good faith in light of my
incredible patience and understanding with this issue, but to meet your
obligations to provide a safe and habitable living space.

Despite elevated moisture readings (48 and above) and the fact that this is
the sixth or seventh flooding incident in this unit, no formal mold testing
or air quality assessment has been done. The vendor only used a moisture
meter and a thermal camera, with no material sampling, no inspection behind
the walls beyond pinpricks from the sensor, and no air testing.

When I directly asked the moisture professional whether his team performs
mold testing, he told me no and stated that a third party could be brought
in for that purpose. This makes it clear that no one with proper mold
assessment expertise has evaluated the conditions inside my unit. Given
that mold can begin developing within 24 to 48 hours of elevated moisture,
and considering the repeated flooding history, it is unacceptable to
proceed with repairs without first ensuring that hidden mold is not present=
.

I am requesting that a licensed mold assessor or air quality professional
be brought in before any further repairs take place. I expect confirmation
of how this will be handled.

Thank you. I look forward to your prompt response.
