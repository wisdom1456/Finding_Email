 developing within 24 to 48 hours of elevated moisture, and considering the r=
epeated flooding history, it is unacceptable to proceed with repairs without=
 first ensuring that hidden mold is not present.<br><br>I am requesting that=

<br><br>Thank you for arranging the moisture readings, they have now set up a=

f assessments happen as early as possible if similar issues arise.<br><br>

Regarding the moisture readings: since elevated levels (48 and above) were f=
ound and it has now been over nine days since the flooding occurred, I=E2=80=
=99m concerned about the potential for mold growth. I understand that mold c=
an begin developing within 24 to 48 hours of elevated moisture, and given th=
at this is the sixth or seventh instance of flooding in the unit, it=E2=80=99=
s possible that dormant spores from earlier events may have been reactivated=
 this time. While I appreciate that drying equipment has been set up, I thin=
k it would be prudent to arrange for a professional mold assessment or air q=
uality testing to ensure there is no hidden growth and that the apartment re=
mains safe and healthy.
